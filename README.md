project title

project description: The project is to discover and conduct a analysis on the context of the book analysis. In this bnook analysis I examine the the content of the first sentences of the top ten books banned.

rationale statement: There is an increase of the banning of books across the United States. This is aluded to the increase of content of books and subject matter. This analysis is to validate the analysis of the book ban.

workflow: Pandas library was used to integrate file into the code. This will provide the data from the organization PEN America organization which nationally covers the subejct of the book ban and all related subject matter. Once code provides the data frame code is used to create data visualization in order to coduct a compare and contrast of the data. We used the API provided by Openlibrary organiation to gain data about the books being banned and to conduct further analysis in the next additonal step.

further uses: issues may arise with using the Open Library and working with the API. To further use the data from the API a code loop was created in order to properly gain access.
